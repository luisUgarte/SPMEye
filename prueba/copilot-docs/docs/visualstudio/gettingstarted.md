## Prerequisites

- You will need VS 2022 17.1 or later: https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/visual-studio-2022-17-1-is-now-available/

## 1. Installing the Visual Studio extension

To use GitHub Copilot, you first need to install the Visual Studio extension.

1. Open Visual Studio. 

2. In Extensions | Manage Extensions, from the Visual Studio Marketplace, install the GitHub Copilot extension for Visual Studio.

## 2. Seeing your first suggestion

GitHub Copilot provides suggestions for dozens of languages and a wide variety of frameworks, 
but it works especially well for Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, Go, C#, and C++. 
The following samples are in C#, but other languages will work similarly.

1. Create a new C# Console App project by following the instructions in steps 1 and 2 [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/get-started/csharp/tutorial-console?view=vs-2022#:~:text=1%20Tutorial%3A%20Create%20a%20simple%20C%23%20console%20app,yet%20have%20fail%20safes%20in%20place%20to%20).  

2. Name your project "Copilot Demo".

<img alt="Configure your new project" src="resources/configure-new-project.png" width="600"></img>

3. Click "Next".

<img alt="Additional information" src="resources/configure-additional-information.png" width="600"></img>

4. Click "Create".

   1. The very first run, you will be presented with a message to activate your connection to GitHub

<img alt="First run authorization" src="resources/first-run-authorize.png" width="448"></img>

   2. A device code will be copied automatically to the clipboard. Paste it on the GitHub device authorization page that will open. If you miss the device code, you will find it in the status bar, at the bottom left of Visual Studio, as well as on the GitHub Copilot output window pane.
   
<img alt="First run device code" src="resources/first-run-device-code.png" width="443"></img>
<img alt="First run device code output" src="resources/first-run-device-code-output.png" width="711"></img>
   
   3. After successful authorization, proceed to read and approve the [telemetry terms](https://github.co/copilot-telemetry-terms).

<img alt="First run telemetry consent" src="resources/first-run-telemetry-terms.png" width="423"></img>

After installation, a GitHub Copilot icon should appear in the editor margin at the bottom of your Visual Studio window, in the lower left.

<img alt="icon" src="resources/visual-studio-copilot-icon.png" width="316"></img>

and your file should show short "Hello, World!" code.

<img alt="Hello, world!" src="resources\hello-world.png" width="600"></img>

1. Below that, type the following function header:

   ```
   int CalculateDaysBetweenDates(
   ```

2. GitHub Copilot will automatically suggest an entire function body in grayed text, as shown below. 
The exact suggestion may vary.

   <img alt="Code suggested by GitHub Copilot" src="resources/calculate-days-between-dates.png" width="600"></img>

7. Press `Tab` to accept the suggestion.

GitHub Copilot will attempt to match your code's context and style. You can edit the suggested code as you choose.

## 3. Choosing alternate suggestions

For any given input, GitHub Copilot can provide multiple suggestions. 
As the developer you are always in charge; you can select which suggestion to use, or reject them all.

1. Clear the file (or start a new one), and type the following again:

   ```
   int CalculateDaysBetweenDates(
   ```

2. GitHub Copilot will again show you a suggested completion.

3. Instead of pressing `Tab`, press `Alt`+`.` (or `Alt`+`,`).

   GitHub Copilot will cycle through other alternative suggestions.

<img alt="Alternate code suggested by GitHub Copilot" src="resources/alternate-calculate-days-between-dates.png" width="600"></img>

4. When you see a suggestion you like, press `Tab` to accept it.

5. If you don't like any of the suggestions, press `Esc`.

You can also hover over a suggestion to see the GitHub Copilot command palette for choosing suggestions.

## 4. Generating code from a comment

GitHub Copilot can understand significantly more context than most code assistants, 
and can generate entire functions from something as simple as a comment. 

1. Clear the file (or start a new one), and type the following:

   ```csharp
   using System.Xml.Linq;

   var doc = XDocument.Load("index.xhml");
   
   // find all images
   ```

   Press `Enter`.

2. GitHub Copilot will automatically suggest an implementation. Press "tab" to accept it.

2. Enter a second comment

   ```csharp
   // and give them a red border
   ```

## 8. Enabling and disabling GitHub Copilot

The GitHub Copilot status icon in the bottom panel of the Visual Studio window
indicates whether GitHub Copilot is enabled or disabled. It will have a diagonal line through it when disabled. To enable or disable GitHub Copilot, click the icon. You will be
asked whether you wish to toggle for the current file, current file type, or globally.
